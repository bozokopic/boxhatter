Box Hatter
==========

Box Hatter is continuous integration server/executor. It provides isolated
execution environments, for running automated actions, as containers managed
by podman or docker.

Key features:

    * automated projects based on git repositories
    * containers as execution runners
    * per project configuration as YAML file inside project's repository
    * web based control and monitoring interface (without JavaScript)
    * webhook/periodic execution triggering
    * CLI executor


Runtime requirements
--------------------

* python >=3.8
* git
* podman or docker


Install
-------

::

    $ pip install boxhatter


Running
-------

Box Hatter enables execution of actions described by simple YAML files which
contain container image name and Posix shell execution script. Actions files
are stored as part of git repositories (default name of action file is
`.boxhatter.yaml`, stored in root of git working tree).

These actions can be executed with::

    $ boxhatter execute <path>

where ``<path>`` is path to git repository containing action definition.
Referenced git repository can be local or remote.

Additionally, Box Hatter can be run as daemon providing web server interface::

    $ boxhatter server

When run as server, Box Hatter periodically lists configured git repository
references, and schedules action executions if new commits are available.
New commit checking can also be triggered by webhooks available at listening
`/repo/<repo_name>/webhook` URL path (``<repo_name>`` is configured repository
name).

Box Hatter server provides basic web GUI which can be used for monitoring
action executions and scheduling new executions based on user provided
git reference.

Action and server configurations are defined and documented by JSON schemas
`<schemas_json/action.yaml>`_ and `<schemas_json/server.yaml>`_.

For additional options, see::

    $ boxhatter --help
